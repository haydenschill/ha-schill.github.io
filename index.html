  <div class="about">
    <p> 
     I am a PhD candidate at the University of California at San Diego, working in Dr. Timothy Brady's <a href = "https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Vision and Memory Lab.</a> Before starting at UCSD, I was a lab manager at Brigham & Women's Hospital/Harvard Medical School in Dr. Jeremy Wolfe's <a href = "http://search.bwh.harvard.edu/new/index.html" target="_blank"> Visual Attention Lab</a>, and received my undergraduate BS in Neuroscience at Rhodes College working with <a href = "https://jasonmarchaberman.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Jason Haberman</a> on the capacity limitations of Ensemble Perception. 
   </p>

   <p> 
     My research interests include investigating the structure of memory broadly, as well as the applied nature of psychology research, whether that be scaling up models to account for more complex representations we encounter in the world, or examining how perceptual and attentional biases function outside the laboratory, such as in the field of radiology. I was recently awarded the National Science Foundation's Graduate Student Research Fellowship to support these endeavors.
