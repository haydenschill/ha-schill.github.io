                <p> My research program is focused on determining the structure and function of the human memory system. In particular, I am interested in how memory relates to expertise, as well as the relationship between working memory and long-term memory. </p>

         <div class="heading"><h2><strong>Uncovering the structure of complex memory representations</strong></h2></div>

         <div class = prettyP>
                <p> In one set of projects, I investigate the memory structure of more complex representations such as scenes. Specifically, I look at whether memory for scenes can be explained simply by their similarity structure, as suggested by the signal detection model of memory (TCC) proposed by Schurgin et al. (2018). In order to do this, I first created a novel continuous scene stimuli database by extracting temporally evenly spaced frames from drone videos. We then had N=100 undergraduates rate the similarity of each of the images in each of the categories of the new stimuli set, and subsequently ran an independent memory experiment to see if scene similarity predicts memory confusiability for scene representations. You can find an abstract and relevant figures for this project <a href="publications/Schill_VSS20_Abstract.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="publications/Schill_Supplemental.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

                <p> Previous research has found that experts have better memory for items within their domain of expertise. We also know that surprising or abnormal items tend to capture our attention and lead to better memory. How do these two ideas interact? In this project, I investigate whether expert radiologists have bettern memory for abnormal (cancerous) mammograms compared to normal (noncancerous) mammograms. You can find the preprint of this project <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/b4zv3/" target="_blank">here</a></li>. </p>

          <div class = prettyP>
                <p> In another project, I examine whether and how radiologists are influenced by visual hindsight bias, which is the notion that prior information about an image enhances our perception of that image. While the evidence that this bias is present in expert radiologist populations is robust anecdotally, it is severely lacking experimentally. To examine this, we presented N=40 experienced mammograph readers with a series of unilateral abnormal mammograms (half had calcifications; half had masses). Critically, the images would either start out degraded – and then become clearer with each passing image – or start out clear – and become more degraded with each passing image. Our prediction is that when radiologists start out with the no noise (e.g. original) image, they will have more information starting out that will enhance their perception of the images as they become more degraded. Our results suggests suggest that experts aren’t immune to the Hindsight Bias. Future analyses will look at the extent different types of lesions elicit this bias (i.e. masses vs. calcifications). </p>
